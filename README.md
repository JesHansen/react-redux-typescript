This project is a tribute to Cory Houses's Pluralsight course: 'Building Applications with React and Redux'.

Each commit in this project should, more or less, correspond to an episode of Cory's lecture, with one change. Instead of using plain Javascript this repo will attempt to recreate Cory's app in Typescript.
